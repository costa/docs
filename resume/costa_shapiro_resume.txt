Costa Shapiro

A software engineering professional (M.Sc. in CS) with over 10 years of industry experience in various areas, interested in problem-solving software R&D


Interests

Ruby-based development
    To me, it is just the best industry-accepted tool for expressing software reasoning which allows to stay focused on the task while maintaining overall development efficiency. It takes the whole development experience to a new level, when practically appropriate, of course.

User-oriented development
    Usability-driven design, on both human user and system component levels is my preference for successful and enjoyable development. It is important for me to assess different aspects of usability (such as fitness for a particular purpose versus universal reuse potential) regularly in the software development cycle.

Component-pragmatic development
    When developing any product-oriented system, I support agile component evolvement through functionally defined iterations (while tracking all the decisions and activity) to keep things team-maintainable at all times.

Open Standards and Source involvement
    I'm trying to be always updated on the open standards development, as supporting relevant ones commonly multiplies the application opportunities for a software system. It also seems to me that most companies using and contributing to open-source projects just benefit from the interaction.

Social and personal segment software
    After many years closely tracking the information technologies development, I've gained both experience and hunger for building useful and accessible services.
